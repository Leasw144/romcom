##Introduction

As part of the Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End Module One curriculum, we have created a website which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to display randomized data (Cover image, title, and two descriptors) from a database, provide the user an option to save their favorite combinations, and allow the user to customize their own romance novel like the one we have linked above.

##Features
